# Bachelor Thesis
The thesis task was to create a simple ship simulator, that will model a unit floating on a water surface.
To accomplish that, water has been interpreted as a finite grid of vertices with different heights.
The ship's hull on the other hand, is simulated with usage of three dimensional grid, that
based on its cells immersion level with respect to the heightfield, calculates both: a point and a force of buoyancy.
At each frame PhysX library, supplied with all the information, computes the ship transformations in a current step of
the simulation. The application allows one to tweak all parameters via its extensive graphical user interface and
freely move around the scene. What is more, the ship can be controlled by applying different forces at the front
of its hull.

## Building<a name="build"></a>
Note: Currently only Windows platform is supported. Sources have been checked on Windows 10 64bit.
Please let me know about any issues.
- In repository main folder call following commands:

    ```
   mkdir [project directory]
   cd [project directory]
   cmake ..
    ```
- Open 
   ```
   [repository main folder]\[project directory]\BachelorThesis.sln
    ```
- Change *Debug* to *Release* and click Build->Build Soulution.

## Setup.exe<a name="setup"></a>
It is is possible to create setup executable for the application from the repository sources. Please first [build](#build) the app and then make use of the following steps:
- Install [Inno Setup Compiler](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)
- Go to 
   ```
   [repository main folder]\[project directory]\Release\win_installer
   ```
- Open and compile
   ```
   [repository main folder]\[project directory]\Release\win_installer\win_installer.iss
   ```
- Setup executable resides in:
   ```
   [repository main folder]\[project directory]\Release\win_installer\Output
   ```

## Usage
To run the application either use [setup executable](#setup) or [build](#build) it and run:
```
[repository main folder]\[project directory]\Release\bachelor_water.exe 
```
Window with the simulation should pop up along with a console.

Any configuration can be done via modifying:
```
[repository main folder]\[project directory]\Release\config.ini
```
or 
```
[installation directory]\config.ini
```
(depending on the previous steps). Some of the entries (e.g. resolution, fullscreen or number of quads) are not mutable during runtime, hence the file is the only way to set them.
